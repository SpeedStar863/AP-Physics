Welcome! I am delighted to be your mentor through one of the hardest classes you will take in high school, but by the end of your experience, these tricky concepts will transform into basic logic. College Board has notoriously made this course one of its most challenging, but after you give me a little bit of your time and attention each day, I guarantee that you will get something out of this. It is my passion to help students feel less pressure in the classroom, so I made this guide as beginner-friendly as possible. Let's start with Unit 1: Kinematics.

## KINEMATICS

Before we start, let's learn a few essential key points and definitions. Kinematics combines algebra and geometry to analyze motion in objects but ignores the effects of forces, which will play a role in an object's motion as the course develops.

### Key Terms and Definitions

#### Scalar - a physical quantity that only has magnitude (no direction)

* Speed - how fast an object is moving, the rate at which it covers distance
* Magnitude - the size or strength of a physical quantity, without reference to direction
* Temperature - a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance
* Volume - the amount of space an object occupies
* Energy - the ability to do work or cause change
* Mass - measure of matter in an object
* Distance - the total length that an object has traveled

#### Vector - a physical quantity that has magnitude AND direction

* Velocity - the rate of change of position
* Acceleration - the rate of change of velocity
* Position - the location of an object in a 1d or 2d shape
* Displacement - the change of position over time

### Symbols

#### Velocity
$\vec{v}$

#### Acceleration
$\vec{a}$

#### Position
$\vec{x}$

#### Displacement
$\Delta\vec{x}$


Now, I want you to look carefully at these symbols and try to identify which are vector quantities and which are scalar quantities.

Actually, they are all vector quantities! If we scroll above, we will see that scalar quantities do not have direction, while vector quantities do. The arrow above each variable represents direction in physics. The variable itself represents magnitude, which is the only factor that makes up a scalar quantity.

Next, I want you to think of the term scalar, how can we transform a vector quantity into a scalar quantity? Remember its definition and key points, a scalar value only represents a vector's magnitude. In other words, we can remove the arrow from each vector quantity to create a scalar quantity. For example, $v$ no longer represents velocity, it now represents speed which is the magnitude of velocity, all because the arrow was removed. Not every scalar quantity of a vector has a name, however, so we can just say magnitude of acceleration to prove our point.

#### Key Takeaways

* Magnitude is always positive
* Scalar and vector quantities are closely related, but different in definition
* Arrow represents direction
* Variable represents magnitude
* $\Delta$ represents change over time

#### Further Information

* Vectors can be positive or negative values
* Basic scalar quantities are positive
* The point of reference (reference point) is usually set to 0 and represents the **initial position** of an object
* The conventional coordinate system follows a left/down=negative and right/up=positive pathway
* Make sure you can visualize every physics problem!
